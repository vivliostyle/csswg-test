The purpose of tests is to demonstrate differences in browsers so that the browsers can be fixed to
work the same.

First find a feature you want to test.

https://drafts.csswg.org/css-ui/#box-sizing
[[
padding-box
The specified width and height (and respective min/max properties) on this element determine the
padding box of the element. That is, any padding specified on the element is laid out and drawn
inside this specified width and height. The content width and height are calculated by subtracting
the padding widths of the respective sides from the specified ‘width’ and ‘height’ properties. As
the content width and height cannot be negative ([CSS21], section 10.2), this computation is floored
at 0.
]]
Read the relevant part of the spec several times until you understand what it means. In the case of
padding-box, we can visualize what it does like this:

http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/saved/2630 (test in Firefox)

When writing the test case we don't want to use browser-specific prefixes, just the standard
property.

Things to test:
* The width calculation for
  - different 'display'
  - floats
  - position:absolute
  - replaced elements
  - form controls
* That the width content can't be negative
* That it doesn't inherit
* getComputedStyle() (see CSSOM spec)

Let's test width computation for display:block, see
box-sizing-padding-box-block-001.html
box-sizing-padding-box-block-001-ref.html

This test sets box-sizing to padding-box and width to 150px and padding to 50px, which means that
the content width should be 50px.

The reference file should have the same rendering as the test when the test passes, without using
the feature that you're trying to test. In this case we just set the width to 50px. The reference
file can be used by several tests so shouldn't point to the spec and can have a generic title and
even file name. Tests are connected to the reference using a manifest file (using the meta tag).
